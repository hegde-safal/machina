1. Vernacular Content Moderation for Regional Social Media
Problem Context: With India's internet population growing rapidly in Tier 2/3 cities, regional
language content on platforms like ShareChat, Moj, and community WhatsApp groups has
exploded. However, existing content moderation tools are optimized for English and fail to
detect hate speech, misinformation, and harmful content in Indian languages that use complex
scripts (Devanagari, Tamil, Telugu, etc.), code-mixing (Hinglish), and cultural context.
The Challenge: Hate speech in regional languages often relies on cultural references, historical
events, caste-based slurs, and religious innuendos that don't translate directly. A phrase that
seems innocent in literal translation might carry deeply offensive meaning in local context.
Additionally, users bypass filters using phonetic spelling, script mixing, and regional memes.
Why It Matters: 90% of new internet users in India prefer regional languages. Without effective
moderation, these platforms become breeding grounds for communal tension, with real-world
consequences including mob violence and social unrest. Current global AI models lack the
cultural-linguistic training data to address this effectively.
2. Intelligent Document Processing for Infrastructure Operations
Problem Context: Organizations operating complex infrastructure generate massive volumes
of diverse documents across engineering, operations, procurement, HR, safety, and
compliance. These files arrive in fragmented formats and channels, creating delays, siloed
visibility, compliance risk, duplicated work, and loss of institutional knowledge.
The Challenge: What's needed is a system that can automatically condense, contextualize, and
distribute critical information to the right stakeholders with full traceability to original sources,
enabling faster and more reliable decision-making across the organization.
Why It Matters: Without automated processing and intelligent routing, critical information gets
lost in document silos, compliance deadlines are missed, and decision-making is delayed due to
inability to quickly access and synthesize relevant information from multiple sources.
3. Agricultural Input Subsidy Leakage Detection
Problem Context: The Indian government spends over ₹70,000 crores annually on agricultural
subsidies for fertilizers, seeds, and equipment through a network of dealers and cooperatives.
However, a significant portion of these subsidies never reaches farmers. Dealers inflate
beneficiary lists with ghost farmers, divert subsidized goods to the open market at higher prices,
or create fake invoices for supplies never delivered. The distribution chain involves multiple
intermediaries across districts, making it difficult to track whether subsidies actually benefit
intended recipients.
The Challenge: Subsidy claims show unusual patterns like the same dealer consistently
serving unusually high numbers of farmers compared to regional averages, beneficiaries
receiving fertilizer quantities that exceed their reported land holdings, or geographically
clustered claims that suggest coordinated fraud. However, these patterns are hidden across
thousands of transactions, multiple crop seasons, and different subsidy schemes. Manual audits
happen annually and only spot-check a tiny fraction of transactions, missing systematic fraud.
Why It Matters: Subsidy leakage means farmers pay market prices while taxpayers fund
phantom beneficiaries, undermining both agricultural productivity and government finances.
Real farmers in remote areas miss out on crucial support during planting season, while corrupt
dealers profit. Detecting anomalous distribution patterns could redirect billions toward genuine
agricultural development and improve rural livelihoods.

4. UPI Transaction Fraud Pattern Detection
Problem Context: India processes over 10 billion UPI transactions monthly, but the instant,
irrevocable nature of UPI has spawned sophisticated fraud patterns. Scammers use social
engineering combined with small verification transactions, fake payment confirmation
screenshots, QR code swapping at merchant locations, and refund scams where victims are
tricked into entering their UPI PIN on fake refund pages.
The Challenge: Unlike credit card fraud with chargeback windows, UPI fraud is instant and
irreversible. Fraudsters exploit the trust-based ecosystem by impersonating delivery personnel,
customer service agents, or even relatives in distress. Traditional rule-based systems generate
too many false positives (blocking legitimate family transfers) or miss novel attack patterns that
evolve weekly.
Why It Matters: UPI fraud cost Indians over ₹1,000 crores in 2024, with victims often being
first-time digital payment users from rural areas who lack digital literacy. Banks face reputational
damage but have limited tools to prevent rather than just report fraud.
5. HTTP Traffic Attack Pattern Analysis
Problem Context: Modern organizations face increasing cyber threats exploiting vulnerabilities
in the HTTP protocol, especially through maliciously crafted URLs. Attackers use techniques like
SQL injection, XSS, command injection, directory traversal, SSRF, and credential-stuffing to
compromise systems, steal data, or gain unauthorized access. Security teams struggle to
manually inspect massive traffic logs or IPDR data to detect and distinguish attempted attacks
from successful breaches.
The Challenge: There is a need for a system that can automatically analyze HTTP traffic,
identify and classify URL-based attack patterns, separate attempts from successful intrusions,
and provide actionable visibility through search, filtering, reporting, and PCAP ingestion to
support rapid incident response.
Why It Matters: Without automated analysis, security teams are overwhelmed by log volume,
miss sophisticated attack patterns, and cannot effectively distinguish between failed attempts
and successful compromises, leaving organizations vulnerable to undetected breaches.
Blockchain Domain
6. Cooperative Society Digital Ledger Transparency
Problem Context: India has 8.5 lakh cooperative societies managing assets worth ₹10 lakh
crores, serving rural communities with credit, agricultural supplies, and housing. However, these
societies frequently face embezzlement, opaque accounting, and manipulation by powerful local
figures. Members (often small farmers or low-income families) cannot verify how their deposits
are used or whether loans are distributed fairly.
The Challenge: Traditional paper-based or poorly digitized record-keeping allows society
officials to manipulate accounts, give preferential loans to relatives, or siphon funds. Audits
happen once a year and are often perfunctory. Members lack real-time visibility into
transactions, pending loan applications, or dividend calculations. Trust erosion leads to
members withdrawing, collapsing vital rural financial infrastructure.
Why It Matters: Cooperative societies are financial lifelines for 290 million Indians, especially in
areas without bank branches. Corruption and mismanagement directly impact farmers' access
to credit during planting season and families' savings security. A transparent, tamper-proof
system could restore trust and improve rural financial inclusion.
7. Digital Content Copyright Authentication
Problem Context: Copyright infringement is a growing problem amongst online creators.
Blockchain can help fix that by providing authentication for internet content. Numbers protocol,
for example, is a blockchain camera app that provides a unique and recorded verification
number for every piece of media captured with it.
The Challenge: Viewers can scan for the verification number when the creator or anyone else
shares the media, ensuring there's no copyright infringement.
Why It Matters: Online creators struggle to prove ownership and authenticity of their content,
leading to widespread unauthorized use and loss of revenue. A blockchain-based verification
system can provide immutable proof of original creation.

8. Multilingual AI Loan Advisor Application
Problem Context: People struggle with loan applications due to confusing eligibility
requirements, unclear documentation processes, language barriers, and low financial literacy,
which leads to rejected applications and wasted time. Most existing solutions rely on static forms
and English-only interfaces, offering little personalized guidance.
The Challenge: To address this, the goal is to build an Android application featuring a
multilingual conversational AI Loan Advisor that interacts via voice or text, understands users'
financial context, determines their intent dynamically, provides real-time loan eligibility checks,
guides them step-by-step through the loan application process, and delivers practical financial
education.
Why It Matters: Making the loan journey simpler, accessible, and stress-free for everyone,
especially users from non-English speaking backgrounds with limited financial literacy who are
currently excluded from formal lending systems.
Education Tech Domain
9. Vernacular STEM Learning Gap Analysis
Problem Context: India's National Education Policy 2020 mandates mother-tongue education
until Grade 5, but quality STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) content in regional
languages is scarce. YouTube, Khan Academy, and coaching platforms are overwhelmingly
English-centric. Students in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, or UP learn science in their regional
language but lack quality supplementary resources, interactive simulations, or doubt-clearing
platforms in those languages.
The Challenge: Simply translating English content doesn't work. Scientific terminology,
pedagogical approaches, and examples need cultural localization. A physics problem about
baseball means nothing to a student in rural Odisha. Additionally, teachers struggle to assess
which specific STEM concepts students are failing to grasp, leading to rote memorization rather
than conceptual understanding. There's no data-driven way to identify that students in
Hindi-medium schools struggle specifically with electrochemistry analogies versus students
misunderstanding the concept itself.
Why It Matters: India's engineering and medical entrance exams are offered in 13 languages,
but preparation resources are English-dominated, creating unfair disadvantages. This
perpetuates educational inequality. Bright students from vernacular backgrounds drop out of
STEM paths due to language barriers, not aptitude. Bridging this gap could unlock India's full
scientific talent pool.
10. Behavioral Analytics for Online Assessment Integrity
Problem Context: The core problem is maintaining academic integrity in online assessments
without intrusive video-based proctoring, by designing a scalable, privacy-compliant system that
analyses non-invasive behavioural signals such as mouse movement patterns, keystroke
dynamics, and window-switching activity to generate a real-time risk score that adapts
dynamically to user behaviour and triggers appropriate automated interventions when
suspicious patterns emerge.
The Challenge: The challenge is to detect cheating effectively while minimizing false positives,
ensuring a seamless candidate experience, enabling flexible integration of monitoring tools
without rigid rule-based logic, and supporting large-scale deployment that respects data
protection regulations like GDPR and FERPA.
Why It Matters: Current video-based proctoring is invasive, creates privacy concerns, and
causes anxiety for honest students. A behavioral analytics approach can maintain integrity while
respecting privacy and providing a better assessment experience.
General Innovation Domain
11. Gig Worker Rights Verification System
Problem Context: India has 15+ million gig workers (delivery riders, cab drivers, freelancers on
platforms like Swiggy, Uber, Urban Company). These workers face arbitrary account
deactivations, withheld earnings, unexplained penalties, and lack transparency into rating
systems or payout calculations. When a Zomato rider's account gets suspended, they often
don't know why, have no appeal process, and lose their only income source overnight.
The Challenge: Platform algorithms make opaque decisions about worker performance,
earnings, and access. Workers can't verify if they're being fairly rated, whether they received all
entitled bonuses, or why they were deactivated. Platforms claim proprietary algorithms while
workers have no recourse except customer service chatbots. There's no neutral system to audit
platform decisions or give workers evidence for labor disputes.
Why It Matters: Gig workers operate in a legal grey area. They are not employees (no labor law
protection) but not independent contractors (can't negotiate terms). Without transparency,
platforms can unfairly exploit workers who have no alternative income. A verification system
could balance platform needs with worker rights, creating accountability without revealing
business-critical algorithms.
12. Intelligent Candidate Discovery and Matching Platform
Problem Context: Right now hiring is painfully inefficient: HR teams waste hours jumping
across platforms like LinkedIn, Naukri, and random job boards, manually searching and
shortlisting candidates based on vague keyword matches that often miss actual skill and role fit.
The process is slow, biased, and heavily dependent on guesswork rather than data, leading to
bad hires, lost productivity, and frustrated candidates.
The Challenge: The real problem is that job descriptions rarely translate into meaningful
matches because current systems can't understand context, measure real competence, or
evaluate compatibility beyond surface-level filters. You need a platform that ingests job
descriptions, interprets them semantically, auto-discovers and ranks suitable candidates across
sources, and continuously learns from hiring patterns to make accurate recommendations.
Why It Matters: Turning hiring from a chaotic manual hunt into a fast, intelligent, data-driven
pipeline that reduces time-to-hire, improves candidate quality, and eliminates bias from the
recruitment process.
