Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)
Detailed Project Roadmap & System Blueprint
This document describes the full roadmap, architecture, RAG design, database structure, and user
workflows for the IDP platform to be built in a 12-hour hackathon.
1. High-Level Goal
Build a web-based Intelligent Document Processing platform where an Admin can upload organizational
documents (PDF/DOCX, optionally images), which are automatically processed to extract text, summarize
content, classify the document type, route to a department, assign priority and due date, maintain status
(Pending, In-Review, Replied), enable Admin–Employee chat, and support semantic search.
2. Roadmap & Build Order (12-Hour Hackathon)
Phase 1 – Core: Auth, upload, OCR/text extraction, summarization, classification, routing, status, chat,
and semantic search.
Phase 2 – Enhancements: Priority tagging, due date extraction, AI-suggested replies.
Phase 3 – Polish & Demo: UI refinement, sample documents per department, full dry-run.
3. Frontend (Next.js) – Structure & Behaviour
Pages:
- /login: username/password fi redirect to admin or employee dashboard based on role.
- /admin/dashboard: upload widget + recent documents table + search entry point.
- /admin/document/[id]: summary, extracted text, category, department, priority, due date, status, and chat.
- /admin/search: semantic search with natural language query.
- /employee/dashboard: list of documents for employee's department.
- /employee/document/[id]: view summary, status, due date, and chat.
- /employee/search: semantic search limited to that department.
4. Backend (FastAPI) – Services & Endpoints
Core endpoints:
- POST /login: validate dummy users and return role/department.
- POST /upload or /process: handle file upload, OCR/text extraction, summarization, classification, routing,
priority and due date extraction, FAISS indexing, and document creation.
- GET /documents: list of documents (all for admin, filtered by department for employees).
- GET /document/{id}: full document details.
- POST /search: semantic search via FAISS.
- POST /chat/send and GET /chat/history/{doc_id}: chat per document.
- POST /status/update: update status (e.g., In-Review when employee opens a document).
5. RAG & Semantic Search Design
Indexing:
- Chunk extracted text per document.
- Embed each chunk using an embedding model.
- Store embeddings in FAISS with metadata (doc_id, department, chunk index).
Search:
- Embed the query, retrieve similar vectors via FAISS, map to doc_ids, aggregate and filter by department
for employees, and return ranked results.
6. Database Design
Tables:
users(id, username, password, role, department)
documents(id, filename, category, department, priority, due_date, status, summary, upload_time)
messages(id, doc_id, sender_role, message, timestamp)
Dummy users: 1 admin and 4–5 employees (Accounts, HR, Procurement, Safety, Engineering).
7. Detailed User Interaction Flows
Admin:
- Logs in fi /admin/dashboard.
- Uploads a document fi system processes and routes it.
- Views document details, reads summary, sees department, priority, due date, and status.
- Uses chat to communicate with department.
- Uses semantic search to retrieve documents.
Employee:
- Logs in fi /employee/dashboard.
- Sees documents routed to their department.
- Opens a document fi status becomes In-Review.
- Reads summary and due date, then replies via chat fi status becomes Replied.
- Uses semantic search limited to their department.
8. Suggested Demo Flow for Judges
1. Explain the problem (manual document handling and routing).
2. Log in as Admin and upload a real-looking document.
3. Show automatic summary, classification, routing, priority, and due date.
4. Switch to an Employee account, show the routed document, status change, and chat reply.
5. Switch back to Admin, display the reply and updated status.
6. Demonstrate semantic search with a natural language query.
7. Conclude with impact and future potential.
